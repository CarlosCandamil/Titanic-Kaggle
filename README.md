Project Overview
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on various features such as age, sex, class, and fare. The project uses machine learning algorithms to train models on the Titanic dataset and evaluate their performance.

Data
The project uses the Titanic dataset, which is not included in this repository. The dataset can be obtained from Kaggle or other sources.

Models
The project uses several machine learning algorithms, including:

Decision Tree Classifier
Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Gradient Boosting Classifier
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Naive Bayes
Logistic Regression
Performance Metrics
The project evaluates the performance of each model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Results
The results of the project are presented in the Jupyter Notebooks, including accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and feature importance plots.
